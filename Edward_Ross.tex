\startSkill
\skill{Communication}
  I enjoy communicating technical concepts to people with a variety of backgrounds and thinking styles. 
  
\skilljump
\exp{Produced multimedia to demonstrate mathematical techniques}
\exp{Designed dynamic tests targeted at pedagogical concepts}
\exp{Document all processes and code to be reusable and comprehensible}
\exp{Presented at the Melbourne Functional User Group}
\exp{Tutored students in mathematics, physics, and computer science}

\skill{Visual Basic for Applications and Excel}
  Proficient at using tools such as Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to track and manage business data.

\skilljump
\exp{Increased production efficiency by automating processes using VBA}
\exp{Used Excel spreadsheets to manage product data}
\exp{Experienced with Excel formulas and macros}

\skill{Analysing and Presenting Data}
 Through my tertiary education and various roles I have experience producing numerical simulations, statistically analysing data, and presenting results.

\skilljump
\exp{Produced and configured simulations using Matlab and Java}
\exp{Analysed large quantities of data using Python and Matlab}
\exp{Contributed to developing, testing and improving user interfaces}
\exp{Independently studied algorithms and data structures}

\skill{Software Development}
I continually strive to rapidly develop programs that are robust and user-friendly.

\skilljump
\exp{Worked in a team to produce and maintain dozens of applications}
\exp{Written hundreds of unit tests}
\exp{Always learning by reading books and using new tools}
\exp{Engage with other developers through Meetup groups}
\exp{Developed in Windows and Linux environments}
  
  
  %I am aware of choosing the right tool for the job; Unix tools for many simple tasks, scripting languages for tasks that need to be done quickly, and languages with solid libraries for complex tasks.
